# Smart home gesture control application

An android application that acts as a smart home control device.
It shows the user videos of gestures performed by experts and then records the actions done by the user.
The requirement is to give the user 3 tries for each gesture and store all the recorded videos to a server.
I have used flask for the server side code and retrofit in android for the client side code.
